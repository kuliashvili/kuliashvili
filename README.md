<h1>Hi there 👋, Greetings from George</h1>
I'm a Front-End Developer. I describe myself as a passionate developer who loves coding, open source, and the web platform ❤️.

I like to create and contribute to open source projects. That helps me to learn a ton of new stuff, grow as a developer and support other open source projects. Also I enjoy writing technical things ✍️ at my blog and medium.

My preferred weapons of choice: 👇
HTML / CSS
Illustrator / Photoshop
JavaScript / TypeScript / Angular
